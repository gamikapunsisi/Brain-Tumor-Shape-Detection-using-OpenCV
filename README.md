# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Shape Detection using OpenCV

This project detects and highlights brain tumor shapes from MRI scans using **OpenCV**.  
It uses image processing techniques such as thresholding, contour detection, and morphological transformations to identify tumor regions in brain images.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Load MRI brain images
- Preprocess images (grayscale, blur, thresholding)
- Detect tumor contours
- Draw bounding boxes or outlines around tumors
- Save processed images
- Simple & lightweight OpenCV implementation
